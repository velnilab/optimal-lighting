# optimal-lighting
Supplemental lighting is an effective means for increasing greenhouse productivity. However, electricity cost of lighting can be significant,
and hence, it is necessary to find optimal lighting strategies to minimize electrical lighting cost. We developed an
optimal supplemental lighting strategy that minimizes electricity cost and implemented this method in a greenhouse. 
The details on the optimal lighting approach is found here: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2021.106300, and the main.py code was used for implementation.
